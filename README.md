# Actron Lizard Piggyback KiCad Symbol & Footprint

This repository contains a KiCad schematic symbol and footprint designed to make it easy to create custom piggyback PCBs that mechanically and electrically connect to the **Lizard Board**. 
[Learn more about the Lizard Board at actron.de](https://www.actron.de/lizard/)

## Features

- Accurate **footprint** with:
  - Mechanical **cutouts** for clearance
  - Clearly labeled **pin positions**
  - Precisely placed **mounting holes**
- Matching **schematic symbol** for quick integration
- Designed for KiCad 6.0+  
- Ideal for rapid prototyping and extension boards

## Contents

- `Lizard_Piggyback.kicad_sym` – Schematic symbol
- `Lizard_Piggyback.kicad_mod` – Footprint with cutouts and mount points

## Usage

1. Add the `.kicad_sym` and `.kicad_mod` files to your project's KiCad library paths.
2. Use the symbol in your schematic and connect it as needed.
3. Place the **Lizard Piggyback** footprint in your layout.
4. Create additional cutouts for USB or SD card in your piggyback board for better accessibility
5. Design your piggyback board.

This enables fast development of plug-on modules for your Lizard-based systems.
2x FTSH-113-01-L-DV are recommended.
